# Temporal Analysis of DC Comic Character Introductions

## Project Overview

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the **DC Comics character dataset** provided by FiveThirtyEight. The focus is on identifying how the **introduction of characters** has evolved over the decades, segmented by:

- **Character Alignment** (Good, Bad, Neutral, Reformed)
- **Gender Representation** (Male, Female, Genderless, Transgender)

The goal is to uncover temporal patterns in DCâ€™s storytelling and character development through a data-driven lens.

## Dataset

The dataset includes metadata on DC Comics characters, including their:
- Year of first appearance
- Alignment
- Gender
- Eye and hair color
- Number of appearances

A snapshot of the raw data is shown below:

## Key Visualizations

### 1. Characters Introduced Per Decade by Alignment

This bar chart shows how the number of characters introduced has changed over time, broken down by alignment (e.g., heroes vs. villains).

**Insight:**  
There were notable spikes in character introductions during the 1980s and 1990s. "Good Characters" consistently made up a large portion, though "Bad Characters" saw the most dramatic increase in the 1990s.

**Insight:**  
The comic industry has historically introduced more male characters. However, there is a visible rise in female characters from the 1980s onward, with small representations of genderless and transgender characters appearing more recently.
